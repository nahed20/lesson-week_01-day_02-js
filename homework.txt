The Age Calculator :

first store declear var currentYear and birthYear in variable 
calculate 2 possible ages based the stored values .
Output them to the screen 

My code solution :
var currentYear = 2019;
var birthYear = 1988;
console.log(currentYear - birthYear);
the output:31
console.log(currentYear - birthYear || currentYear - (birthYear-1));
the output: 31
console.log(" They are " + currentYear - birthYear || currentYear - (birthYear-1));
the output: 32


The Geometrizer:
Store a radius into a variable.
store circumference into a variable , and then calculate the area based on area .

My code solution:
var radius = 2;
var pi = 3.14;
area = pi*radius*radius;
12.56
console.log("The area is " + area );
VM2591:1 The area is 12.56
var circumference = 2 * pi *radius;
console.log("The circumference is " + circumference);
The output: The circumference is 12.56
var circumference = 2*pi*radius;
var circumference = (2*pi*radius);
